          opportunities to build your skills and creativity. Front-end
          developers are responsible for creating the parts of websites that
          users interact with—everything from layouts and buttons to images and
          menus.
        </p>
        <h2>Core Technologies For Web Development</h2>
        <p>
          To become a front-end developer, you'll need to learn the fundamental
          technologies that power websites, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> With these
          skills, you can transform basic designs into fully interactive and
          dynamic web experiences.
        </p>
        <h3>The Fundamental Technologies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of any website,
            used to structure content like headings, paragraphs, and images.
          </li>
          <li>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) brings the layout and design to life,
            controlling the website’s appearance across different devices and
            screen sizes.
          </li>
          <li>
            JavaScript adds functionality and interactivity, making elements
            respond to user inputs and enhancing the user experience.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After gaining a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
          it's important to put your knowledge into practice. One of the best
          ways to learn is by working on small projects like personal websites,
          portfolios, or simple web applications.
