        <p>
          Breaking into the world of front-end web development is an exciting
          journey with plenty of
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>
          opportunities to build your skills and creativity. Front-end developers
          are responsible for creating the parts of websites that users interact
          with—everything from layouts and buttons to images and menus.
        </p>
        <h2>Core Technologies For Web Development</h2>
        <p>
          To become a front-end developer, you'll need to learn the fundamental
          technologies that power websites, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> With these
          skills, you can transform basic designs into fully interactive and dynamic
          web experiences.
        </p>
        <h3>The Fundamental Technologies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of any website, used to
            structure content like headings, paragraphs, and images.
          </li>
          <li>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) brings the layout and design to life,
            controlling the website’s appearance across different devices and screen
            sizes.
          </li>
          <li>
            JavaScript adds functionality and interactivity, making elements respond
            to user inputs and enhancing the user experience.
          </li>
         
        </ul>
        <p>
          After gaining a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's
          important to put your knowledge into practice. One of the best ways to
          learn is by working on small projects like personal websites, portfolios,
          or simple web applications.
